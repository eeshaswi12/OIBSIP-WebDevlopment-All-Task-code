# Oasis InfoByte Internship

# OIBSIP-WebDevlopment-All-Task-code

The first task involved building a Responsive Landing Page using HTML and CSS. This project focused on creating a clean, scrollable layout with anchor-linked navigation and a fixed header. It emphasized semantic HTML structure and responsive styling through media queries, helping me grasp the fundamentals of UI/UX design.
Next, I developed a Personal Portfolio Website, a multi-page site showcasing my skills, projects, and contact information. This project allowed me to implement smooth scrolling, section-based navigation, and embedded GitHub links. I also explored CSS transitions and basic JavaScript enhancements to improve interactivity and user experience.
For the third task, I created a Temperature Converter Web App that enables users to convert values between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app features real-time conversion logic and a responsive interface. This task helped me practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and form validation.
The fourth task was a Basic Calculator Web App, which performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I implemented clear and backspace functionality and designed a responsive layout. This project reinforced my understanding of JavaScript logic, user input handling, and functional UI design.
Finally, I designed a Tribute Page dedicated to a person or concept that inspires me. The page includes a biography, timeline, quotes, and images, all structured in a visually appealing and accessible format. This task emphasized content organization, aesthetic styling, and responsive layout techniques.
Overall, the internship provided a strong foundation in front-end development and design principles. Each project was an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, improve my coding proficiency, and build a portfolio of meaningful work. I am grateful to Oasis Infobyte for this enriching experience and look forward to applying these skills in future professional opportunities.
